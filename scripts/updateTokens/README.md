# Update Tokens Script

This folder contains a script which will fetch all the tokens from https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens, and output all the tokens in a nice JSON file.

This entire folder has been taken from https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/tree/574c628e6189de5b7848c4c10258bc22f42b337c/scripts. Thank you MyCrypto for this.

Please also see [this PR](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/1247) for a description of this script.
